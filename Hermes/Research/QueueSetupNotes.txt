Create custom config section implementation

Config sections:
When producing:
	- Need know the rabbitmq exchange \ queue (this complexity could be hidden by naming)
	- Message type for this exchange (maybe unique message and queue name combination - maybe no, because you can send multiple message to a single queue 
		 consumer will need check every time a message is consumed ie is a subscription setup for this message type so: check message against in memory mapping, 
		 discards message if not subscribed and log it -> this can be handled by the message handler invoker)
			-> Short decription: Setup config in config file so as a subcriber specify the exhanges it wants to hook into, and then only implement the message handlers for the messages you are interested in and log and discard the rest.


When consuming:
	- this queue will be unique per application since every application will bind to the exchange
	- Need to know the rabbitmq PRODUCING exhange (to bind the queue to that exchange)
	- queue name
	- message type for this queue -> Don't need this since the type is inferred from the message type in the message header!
	- opt: type - event or command (for now only event) <- is this even needed?
	- opt: qos
