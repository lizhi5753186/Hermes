When producing:
	- Need know the rabbitmq exchange \ queue (this complexity could be hidden by naming)
	- Message type for this exchange (maybe unique message and queue name combination - maybe no, because you can send multiple message to a single queue 
		 consumer will need check every time a message is consumed ie is a subscription setup for this message type so: check message against in memort mapping, discards message if not subscribed and log it)
	
When consuming:
	- this queue will be unique per application since every application will bind to the exchange
	- Need to know the rabbitmq PRODUCING exhange (to bind the queue to that exchange)
	- queue name
	- message type for this queue
	- opt: type - event or command (for now only event) <- is this even needed?
	- opt: qos
